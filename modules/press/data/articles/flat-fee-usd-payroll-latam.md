🌍 **GLOBAL, July 14, 2025** - 
SigmaRemote, a global payroll automation platform, launched USD payroll corridors in El Salvador, Panama, and Costa Rica. The service eliminates foreign exchange fees and reduces contractor onboarding from days to minutes for businesses hiring Latin American talent.

## 💸 Addressing Costly FX Markups

The launch tackles FX markups ranging 2-5%, as reported across leading global payment providers. For contractors earning $41,000 annually (median remote tech salary in Costa Rica per Himalayas.app), businesses typically pay $820-2,050 in unnecessary FX fees.

> "Traditional payroll systems create unnecessary friction through FX markups and delays," said Kevin Jaspal, CEO of SigmaRemote.
> "Our corridors eliminate the 2-5% fees that cost businesses thousands per contractor annually."

## 🌐 Strategic Market Selection

The three countries offer optimal USD payment conditions:

- **El Salvador** adopted USD as official currency in 2001, creating natural alignment for U.S. businesses.
- **Panama** operates on USD for paper currency with balboa coins pegged 1:1.
- **Costa Rica** shows strong USD orientation with digital nomad visa requirements of $3,000 monthly USD income and over 5,000 visa recipients demonstrating USD-first behavior.

## 🚀 Solution Features

SigmaRemote's USD corridors provide:

- **FX-free USD payouts** via digital wallets (0% FX, flat $10 per transfer)
- **Onboarding via WhatsApp or Telegram** in under 5 minutes
- **Automated compliance** for contracts & tax reporting
- **24-hour setup** vs. 7-14 days with traditional providers

The service eliminates three core pain points:

1. FX markups of 2-5%
2. Payment delays of 3-5 business days
3. Compliance complexity in contractor classification

## 📈 Expansion Plans

SigmaRemote will extend USD corridors to Colombia and Peru by Q3 2025, with AI-powered compliance features including:

- Automatic contractor classification
- Real-time regulatory updates
