USDC payroll now live across LATAM – saving businesses 99% on transfer fees and paying contractors in seconds.

**GLOBAL, July 21, 2025** –
SigmaRemote launched instant USDC stablecoin payroll across Latin America, eliminating $65+ traditional banking fees and 48-hour payment delays for businesses hiring remote contractors.

The launch targets Latin America's $415 billion crypto market - representing 9.1% of global crypto activity - where 60% of workers remain unbanked but 3 million users already hold USDC through platforms like Lemon.

## Traditional Banking Costs Businesses $1,950+ Per Contractor Annually

- SWIFT transfers to LATAM average $65+ per transaction with 48-hour delays
- Traditional remittances cost 1.5–2.9% in fees plus extended processing times
- Stablecoins settle in seconds for $0.01–$1 per transaction

"Banking infrastructure hasn't caught up to Latin America's digital-first workforce," said Kevin Jaspal, CEO of SigmaRemote.
"While Lemon saw 61% growth in USDC holdings across Argentina, Peru, and Brazil, businesses still lose thousands per contractor on outdated payment rails."

## USDC Stablecoin Infrastructure Delivers 24/7 Settlement

SigmaRemote's USDC payroll leverages Circle's regulated stablecoin with $60+ billion in circulation and 1,000+ institutional partnerships.

The solution provides:

- **Instant settlement**: 24/7 payment processing vs. banking business hours
- **99% fee reduction**: $0.01–$1 blockchain fees vs. 1.5–2.9% SWIFT charges
- **20% higher contractor satisfaction**: PWC research shows crypto payroll improves retention rates
- **5-minute onboarding**: WhatsApp/Telegram contractor setup vs. week-long bank account verification

## Strategic Timing Captures $160.9 Billion LATAM Remittance Market

Latin America's remittance market hit $160.9 billion in 2024, representing up to 26% of GDP in countries like El Salvador and Guatemala.

Mexico's Bitso reports 68% of crypto remittance users prefer stablecoins for speed and cost savings.

Regulatory tailwinds create ideal timing:

- El Salvador's Bitcoin adoption
- Panama's crypto framework
- Argentina's inflation-driven USD demand

These shifts pave the way for mass stablecoin payroll adoption across LATAM.

## Market Expansion Targets Colombia, Peru, Chile by Q3 2025

SigmaRemote will expand stablecoin payroll to Colombia, Peru, and Chile by Q3 2025, alongside:

- AI-powered compliance automation
- Contractor classification
- Regional tax reporting across 12 LATAM countries
