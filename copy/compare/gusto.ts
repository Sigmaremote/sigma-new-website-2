    bullets: [
      `Hidden FX markups: Gusto bakes a 1-2.5% FX fee into the exchange rate, with no visibility or control for sender or recipient.`,
      `Surprise withdrawal costs: Contractors may receive $20-$50 less due to SWIFT and intermediary bank fees - and Gusto doesn't cover it.`,
      `No wallet control: Contractors can't hold USD or decide when to convert. Payouts are always auto-converted to local currency.`,
      `Slow cross-border payments: Transfers take 2-5 business days, especially in emerging markets.`,
      `Clunky onboarding for global contractors: Admins must manually upload W-8 BEN forms and manage contract setup through the HR portal.`,
      `Support not optimized for global issues: Gusto's 24/7 support often falls short when resolving international payout or compliance issues.`
