    bullets: [
      `Expensive contractor SaaS model: $49/month plus 1% commission on each payment; discounts only apply at scale.`,
      `Hidden FX behavior: Payment fees and FX markups embedded in unlabeled conversion rates-not clearly disclosed pre-payment.`,
      `Unpredictable bank fees: Contractors in some markets lose $0-$45 to SWIFT or intermediary deductions.`,
      `Delayed payout flow: Self-reported 3-5 day delay in fund arrival, even with nominal intra-US transfers.`,
      `Limited contractor control: No universal USD wallet; contractors rely on platform-directed payout methods.`,
      `Heavy onboarding friction: Sales-driven setup, manual contract/legal handling, slow quote cycle.`,
      `Inconsistent support experience: Delayed responses for payment issues, limited access to live help, and no dedicated account managers for small teams. Contractors may face long resolution times via email-only support.`
