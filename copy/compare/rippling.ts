    intro: `Key frustrations cited by teams using Rippling for contractor payments:`,
    bullets: [
      `Confusing, stacked pricing: Thousands in hidden monthly costs unless you negotiate. Basic payroll starts at $8-$35/user/month, contractor features require consulting.`,
      `Hidden FX markups - FX conversion rates aren't published or guaranteed, meaning businesses can't lock in predictable payout costs`,
      `Correspondent bank charges: Even after Rippling sends payment, intermediary banks deduct $20-$50, reducing payouts.`,
      `Slow cross-border payouts: Especially in emerging markets, SWIFT delays push timelines to days or weeks.`,
      `Limited currency control - No built-in USD wallet for contractors, meaning businesses can't give teams the choice to hold USD and convert at favorable times.`,
      `Onboarding tied to sales cycles - Account setup and compliance clearance are often linked to negotiated deals, slowing time-to-hire`,
      `Customer support pain: Reports of sudden billing spikes, long-term contracts, and limited support responses.`
