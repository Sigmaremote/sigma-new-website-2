## üß™ Additional Tests

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Animations are smooth (60fps)
- [ ] No jank or stuttering
- [ ] Page scrolls smoothly while animations play
- [ ] Animations work on mobile (test with DevTools device emulation)

### Accessibility Tests
1. **Reduced Motion Test:**
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
   - Run: `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches`
   - Enable reduced motion in OS settings
   - Reload page
   - [ ] Animations should be skipped, content appears immediately

### Browser Tests
- [ ] Chrome/Edge
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (Android)

---

## üéØ Quality Checklist

### Visual Quality
- [ ] Animations feel natural, not robotic
- [ ] Timing is not too fast or too slow
- [ ] Elements don't "jump" or have layout shifts
- [ ] Animations enhance the content, don't distract from it

### User Experience
- [ ] User can still interact with the page while animations play
- [ ] Animations don't block scrolling
- [ ] Animations play only once (don't repeat on re-scroll)
- [ ] Text is readable immediately (opacity doesn't stay at 0 too long)

---

## üêõ Common Issues to Check

1. **Animations not triggering:**
   - Make sure you scroll slowly enough for intersection observer to catch
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Animations too fast/slow:**
   - Adjust `duration` values in component files
   - Standard: 0.5-0.7s for most animations

3. **Layout shifts:**
   - All animated elements should maintain their space
   - Check that initial state doesn't cause layout jumps

---

## üì∏ Screenshot Moments

Take screenshots at these moments to verify animations:

1. Hero section fully loaded (after 1.5s)
2. Logos halfway through appearing (after ~0.3s of scroll)
3. Business Features cards mid-animation
4. Financial cards sliding in (catch them mid-slide)
5. Final CTA scaling in

---

## üé¨ Video Recording Recommendation

Record your screen while:
1. Loading the page from scratch
2. Slowly scrolling through all sections
3. Going back up and scrolling down again (verify "once" behavior)

This will help verify the complete animation experience!

---

**Note:** All animations use `once: true`, meaning they only play the first time the section comes into view. This is intentional for better UX!
